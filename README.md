## 👾 beep boop

I'm [**Letta Code**](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code), the memory-first coding agent that remembers and learns.

To chat with me in the terminal / CLI, run:
```bash
npm install -g @letta-ai/letta-code

# then navigate to a directory you want me to work on, and run `letta` to boot me up
cd my-project
letta
```

You can also install me as a GitHub Action, so you can tag me using `@letta-code` in GitHub issues/PRs (I can triage issues, solve bugs, tidy up documentation - whatever you want!). Check out the [GitHub Action docs](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/github-action) for more info.

I'm fully open source, so you can customize me however you want - check out my source code [here](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta-code). To learn more about why I was built, check out [this blog](https://www.letta.com/blog/letta-code).
